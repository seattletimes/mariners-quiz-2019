    "answer": "Jay Bruce",
    "correct": "Despite the speculation after he was included in the return for Edwin Diaz and Robinson Cano, Bruce is in a Mariners uniform on opening day. Whether he’s here on August 1 is another question. But for now, Seattle has a slugging three-time All-Star in its outfield — albeit coming off a below replacement-level season in New York."

Justus will begin the in the Tacoma rotation, though he could be pitching off the T-Mobile Park mound before the end of 2019. “He has been awesome this spring. His changeup has been a real eye-opener. His confidence and poise have stood out,” Jerry Dipoto recently told The New York Post."

Expect him to spend more time in the leadoff spot and roaming center field at T-Mobile Park this time around, following a 3.5-WAR season in Tampa Bay."

    "answer": "Cory Gearrin",
    "correct": "After being traded for the second time of 2018, Gearrin struggled in six appearances to finish the season with the A’s. But the former fourth-round pick still posted the second-lowest ERA (3.77) of his career for a full season. The Mariners, however, will be looking for a return to 2017, when Gearrin had a 1.99 ERA over 68 innings of middle relief for the Giants."

    "correct": "Primarily as the left-handed half of a platoon in Chicago, Narvaez slugged nine home runs with an OPS of .794 in 280 at-bats in 2018 — all career-highs. But no longer does Seattle have one of baseball’s premier defensive catchers in Mike Zunino. By the metric Defensive Runs Saved, only two full-time backstops were worse than Narvaez behind the plate last season."

Now, Tuivailala is expected to slot into the Seattle bullpen sometime around June, when he is fully recovered."

    "answer": "Edwin Encarnacion",
    "correct": "The Mariners were the first victim of Encarnacion’s signature home-run trot. He debuted it on his 123rd homer of his career, a grand slam off Hisashi Iwakuma back in a 7-0 Blue Jays win on April 28, 2012. He’s gone on to hit 257 since, breaking out his ‘Edwing’ each time."

    "correct": "Crawford, a consensus top-100 prospect since he was selected in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft, has apparently been on the Mariners’ radar for some time. When dreaming up different roster-building scenarios, “In virtually all of those, J.P. Crawford was mentioned as a future shortstop for our team,” Dipoto said on The Wheelhouse podcast. But, with a .214 average in 187 MLB at-bats, Crawford will have to refine his bat to match his defensive prowess. Fun fact: the initials stand for John Paul."

    "answer": "Shed Long",
    "correct": "Gaedel, the shortest person to ever play in an MLB game at 3-foot-7, wore “⅛” as his number and played entirely for promotional purposes. Long, on the other hand, is exciting enough to be a promotion himself. Starting the season at Triple-A Tacoma, the 5-foot-8 second baseman will move between the infield and outfield to “see if he has the aptitude to move around the field … (and) take advantage of the athleticism and get that bat in the lineup,” Jerry Dipoto told 710 AM this offseason."

But I earned my spot on the roster this spring, getting on-base nine times in 20 at-bats and proving my ability to play all over the field."
