    "question": "Growing up, I was such a big fan of ‘The Kid’ I actually called the Kingdome and asked to speak with him. Turns out, I did myself one better: I got to share an outfield with the legend himself, Ken Griffey Jr., after I was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds.",

    "question": "I’m the opposite of Mr. Irrelevant — drafted No. 1 overall — but you can’t exactly say the same about my MLB career. The Mariners will be my third team since breaking in to the big leagues in 2013, and they’ll be hoping I can flash the potential I showed with the Orioles in the second half of 2017.",

    "question": "You don’t want to step into the box against my triple-digit heater. Mostly because I don’t always seem to know where it’s going. At 22, I was the youngest player in Mets major-league spring training. If I can harness my command in the bullpen, the Mariners hope I’ll show them why.",
